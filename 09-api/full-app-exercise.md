# Mini Project: API-Powered React App

## Overview

In this mini project, you will build a complete web application that fetches, displays, and interacts with data from a real API.

You'll practice:
- State management with `useState`
- Effect handling with `useEffect`
- Building components driven by real data
- Basic UX patterns: loading, error, success

---

## Objective

Create a small web application that:
- Fetches data from an external API
- Displays the data clearly
- Adds a simple user interaction (like search or filter)

---

## Suggested APIs

Pick one (or suggest another):
- **REST Countries API**: https://restcountries.com/
- **PokeAPI**: https://pokeapi.co/
- **RandomUser API**: https://randomuser.me/
- **Star Wars API (SWAPI)**: https://swapi.dev/

---

## Roadmap

1. **Choose an API**
   - Skim the documentation.
   - Find one or two useful endpoints.

2. **Plan**
   - What data will you fetch first?
   - Sketch your main page layout.

3. **Set Up Your Project**
   - Create a new React + TypeScript project with Vite.
   - Create basic components.

4. **Fetching Data**
   - Use `useEffect` to fetch data.
   - Handle loading, success, and error states.

5. **Display Data**
   - Show the fetched data in a clear, readable way.
   - Break into small components if needed.

6. **Add Interactivity**
   - Add basic searching, filtering, or sorting.

7. **(Optional) Store Preferences**
   - Save user choices (like selected filter) in localStorage.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: API Exploration and Sketch
- Choose your API.
- Explore endpoints.
- Sketch your layout and identify key pieces of data.

### Exercise 2: Initial Setup
- Create your project.
- Set up a main component and empty states (loading, error, success).

### Exercise 3: Fetch Data
- Fetch data in `useEffect`.
- Handle loading and error conditions.

### Exercise 4: Display Data
- Render the data into your app.
- Improve UI iteratively.

### Exercise 5: Add Interaction
- Add a filter, search box, or simple UI control.

### Exercise 6 (Optional): Persist Data
- Save a preference to `localStorage`.
